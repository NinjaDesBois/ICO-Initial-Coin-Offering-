# ICO-Initial-Coin-Offering-
This repo is about a basic webpage for an ICO to mint tokens or claim if you hold CryptoDevs NFT (See my repo "CryptoDevs-NFT-Collection")  made with Hardhat-Solidity and Next.js for my "LearnWeb3 Journey" Thanks again to Learnweb3.io
## Requirements
There should be a max of 10,000 CD tokens.
Every Crypto Dev NFT holder should get 10 tokens for free but they would have to pay the gas fees.
The price of one CD at the time of ICO should be 0.001 ether
There should be a website which users can visit for the ICO.



## Theory
## What is an ERC20?
ERC-20 is a technical standard; it is used for all smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for token implementation and provides a list of rules that all Ethereum-based tokens must follow.
Please look at all the ERC20 functions before moving ahead
